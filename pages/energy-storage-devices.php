      <h2>Description:</h2>
      <p>Storing energy is a great way of using energy when it is available and then using it later on. For example it can be useful for power cuts as it allows time for everything to be powered down to avoid any electrical damage. Energy can be stored in a variety of ways. The most common being electric batteries, heat batteries and thermal stores.<br>
        The electric batteries can help make the most out of the renewable energy. For example solar panel only work in the day but there is a lot of excess energy that gets sold back to the grid. If this energy could be used to charge a battery then energy can be provided during the night as well.<br>
        Heat batteries are used to store spare heat or electricity. The energy is stored in a material as it changes phases from a solid to a liquid. When the heat is needed the material changes back into a solid and release the heat which is used to provide hot water.<br>
        Thermal stores are where excess energy is used to heat up water and is stored in an insulated tank which can be used to provide hot water.

    <h2>How it will be installed:</h2>
    <p><strong>Electrical batteries</strong><br>
      Once a location is chosen which is usually next to the mains panel. Depending on the type of battery which is going to be installed it might be installed on either the wall or the floor. Then the inverter will be connected to the mains panel. Depending on if a solar panel system is installed the battery will be programmed to be charged on excess solar energy generated and is used when the solar energy is not being generated. A transfer is installed to that the house can be run off of the energy from the battery is the case of a power cut. A critical load panel is optional but is recommended to limit the load during the usage of the battery. Finally, whole system is wired together and programmed for optimum usage depend on the homeowner’s setup.<br>
      <strong>Heat batteries</strong><br>
      The Heat battery replaces the hot water cylinder so this has to be removed in order for the hot battery to take it place. The mains water is connected to the input on the heat battery and the hot water is connected to the output. The boiler or high temperature heat pump is then connected, and the heat battery is connected to the power. <br>
      <strong>Thermal stores</strong><br>
      Once the water and electricity are off, the engineer will begin work. Pipes will be installed from the mains supply to the location in which the thermal store will be installed. The thermal store will be installed, and the pipework will be connected up. The heating component of the cylinder will be connected, and the water and electricity will be turned back on.

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p><strong>Electrical batteries</strong><br>
      Depending on what type of battery is installed, the homeowner will be able to monitor the battery charge via the internet or a mobile application. However everything is automated requiring no interference from the homeowner.<br>
      <strong>Heat batteries</strong><br>
      Heat batteries are used to replace the hot water cylinder in the houses hot water system so there is need for the homeowner to interfere with the heat battery but only with the boiler that it is connected to.<br>
      <strong>Thermal stores</strong><br>
      The Thermal store is automated so that the homeowners do not have to monitor or interfere with the system making it easier to maintain.

    <h2>The science:</h2>
    <p><strong>Electrical batteries</strong><br>
      The electrical battery acts as a barrier between the house and the nation power grid. It charges when energy costs are low, and it is used when the energy costs are high allowing for a decrease in the energy bill. This also allows the house to use energy during times of a blackout. Due to safety reason solar panels cannot generate during a blackout however with a battery in place the solar panel can continue to generate and charge the battery which the house is powered by.<br>
      <strong>Heat batteries</strong><br>
      First the battery has to be charged to change the state of the phase change material by absorbing the energy from a power source such as the nation power grid. Then when wot water is needed the battery is discharged and the energy is transferred to the water to increase its temperature. The battery can be charged while how water is being drawn.<br>
      <strong>Thermal stores</strong><br>
      Unlike hot water cylinders thermal stores heat up using a heat exchanger. This heat can then be transferred to transferred from the thermal store to the water mains. There are three methods for storing thermal energy:<br>
      -	Sensible – this is when a material is heated up to increase its temperature. This material is then used to heat the water. There is no change in state of the material<br>
      -	Latent – uses phase change materials (for example heat batteries) whereas the material changes state the materials temperature is constant and the energy is transferred to the water<br>
      -	Thermochemical – this is where a material is broken down into individual components. When the components are brought back together heat is released
