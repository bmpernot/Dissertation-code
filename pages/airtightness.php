    <h2>How it will be installed:</h2>
    <p>Each draught proofing product will come with its own instructions. However for draughtproofing doors and windows make sure to line the edges of the doors and windows to have a continuous seal to ensure it is airtight when the doors and windows are closed.</p>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>When operating the device after making it airtight make sure not to damage the draught proofing as it will not be effective if it cannot make a continuous seal.</p>

    <h2>The science:</h2>
    <p>If the house is airtight it force all heat that wants to get out of the house to transfer the heat though the insulation which is not very effective, therefore keeping the heat inside the house.</p>
