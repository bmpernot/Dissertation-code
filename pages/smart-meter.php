      <p>Smart meters are a useful tool to help monitor gas and electricity meters automatically and can show energy usage in pound and pence. This allows the homeowner to easily identify what is using energy and how they can save costs by changing the way the homeowners and occupants live. Unfortunately not every house can have one as they need to connect to the internet so of the existing meter is outside internet range it cannot be installed. However, there are options to extend internet if applicable.</p>

    <p>Studies shows that there if smart meter is monitored there will be a decrease in energy bill by approximately 16.7% for the first 4 months however this is not sustainable and will increase slowly. An observation was made between having a daily habit to check the smart meter and sustaining the lower energy bill of a medium time frame.</p>
